Our attention shifted to the web applications on ports 80 and 3000, particularly focusing on the captivating codify.htb. Unveiling a critical Node.js vulnerability (CVE-2023-30547) associated with the vm2 library, we crafted a proof-of-concept (PoC) payload, securing a web shell and initiating user-level access. Delving into a web application at /var/www/contact, we deciphered a login mechanism, cracked a user's password, and ascended to root through a sudo-accessible scriptâ€”culminating in a detailed technical exploration on Codify.",

The walkthrough focuses on exploring this web application, using tools like Ffuf to discover valuable endpoints such as '/actuator/sessions'. This reveals an exploitable session ID vulnerability, allowing the attacker to manipulate cookies creatively and gain access to an admin page, establishing a foothold. The write-up covers two lateral movement methods, specifically the extraction of a jar file. Within these files discovers the username and password for a Postgres database, providing further access. Following the escalation path, the guide demonstrates the cracking of the admin user's password hash, granting access to the josh user. Privilege escalation then reveals superuser permissions for the SSH command, ultimately achieving a root shell using a clever technique documented in GTFOBins.",
